The entrance into wireless services from cable companies has been a favorable decision for both the companies and consumers. Comcast, Charter Communications, and Altice USA experienced remarkable success with their offerings of mobile phone service in 2022. You have likely seen Xfinity’s commercials encouraging you to bundle your home internet and phone to save $30 per line on what you would be paying for your current monthly AT&T phone bill. This messaging has resonated with consumers because the three major wireless carriers known as AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, have yet to lower their prices to match those of their cable company rivals.

Comcast's Xfinity Mobile has not been the only popular choice. Charter Communications' Spectrum Mobile and Altice USA's Optimum Mobile also offer reliable unlimited service for an affordable price. The savings these cable companies provide dramatically grew their mobile subscriber by 24-34% in 2022. This success is projected to continue in 2023. 
  
Consumers have been frustrated with high phone bills for a while now, so to justify them, the 3-major carriers may include the latest new device for free or a free year of a streaming service. However, Comcast and Charter Communications choose to directly address the issue by offering phone services that are $15-30 cheaper per line than the major carriers. For two lines, a customer saves an average of $540 a year. These yearly savings are a significant factor and what many consumers seek.

In addition to the lower prices, cable companies offer greater flexibility than a traditional family phone plan. Xfinity Mobile, Spectrum Mobile, and Optimum Mobile allow their customers to adjust their plan month to month, reducing their fear of unexpected financial situations. This flexibility may not be the top priority, but contracts only work for some. The fear of living paycheck to paycheck and not being able to afford a basic necessity like a mobile phone is a reality for many consumers.
 
The last reason cable companies did well in 2022 is that they targeted their residential internet customers. Upselling their current customers for alternative phone service is as simple as asking, "would you like to spend less money on bills easily?". There is already a trusting relationship formed, and customers will be more inclined to simplify their billing. Promotional opportunities will also be even easier to take advantage of when it comes around.
 
The most compelling reason cable companies will continue to see success is due to this current inflation period. In 2021 we experienced a premature re-opening of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the prices of goods increasing. Since then, prices have continued to rise and are not estimated to stop until mid-2023, according to Art Hogan, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at B. Riley Financial (Chang, 2022).
 
Consumers have found success in lowering their spending by switching to cable's wireless options. However, more importantly, customers are happy with the quality of service. Last May, the American Customer Satisfaction Index ranked Altice USA's Optimum Mobile number one in customer satisfaction among full-service wireless providers. Satisfaction, expectation levels, and performance from customer surveys measure each score. This type of acclaim illustrates the effect of affordable phone service.
 
Another reason cable companies will see strong growth is that the three major carriers will refrain from competing by pricing on the low end. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile believe they are in competition amongst each other and want to avoid a free fall in prices that may never pay off (Counterpoint Research).
 
In addition, T-Mobile's CEO, Mike Sievert, stated in an investors conference that the customer type cable is targeting is "a little bit more on the one or two unit households, a little bit more on BYOD [bring your own device]" (Levy, 2022). Sievert believes cable companies are siphoning off consumers who spend less on phone bills. The big three carriers target consumers interested in family plans and/or are willing to sign long-term contracts for the newest devices. This lack of target consumer overlap with the major wireless companies will not provoke immediate strategic action.
 
Lastly, the most significant reason cable companies will experience strong growth in 2023 is that Comcast, Charter Communications, and Altice USA require you to be a customer of one of their residential internet plans to benefit from the savings. There is a significant untapped market of consumers.

If you want to save on your mobile service with a cable company, you must sign up for their home internet. This dramatically shrinks cable companies' consumer base, which likely will not continue long term. Last July, the CEO of Comcast, Dave Watson, stated on an earnings call that Comcast has "barely scratched the surface" in opportunities (Comcast, 2022). At the time, Watson was referring to the 8% of their home internet customers also having their phone service, but there is an even greater market of opportunities outside residential broadband customers.

Looking closer at the numbers, the mobile subscriber growth for cable companies has had staggering growth over each quarter.

This market needs to see a period of regularity before an accurate leveling prediction can be made. But based on what has happened so far, the cable companies’ mobile subscriptions will see strong growth in 2023.
